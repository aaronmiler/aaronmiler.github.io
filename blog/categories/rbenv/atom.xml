<ul>
<li>Quick Switching between Ruby Versions</li>
<li>Upgrade with Git</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Reliable</li>
</ul>


<p>I was using RVM for the longest time, because it is what most everybody recommended. However, I had seen the .ruby-version files throughout other projects, and was wondering why people liked <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a> so much.</p>

<p>Then all of the sudden I started having troubles while switching ruby versions with RVM. My gems got all wonky, and it just became a chore, where I found myself uninstalling my ruby and then reinstalling it just to get it to work properly.</p>

<p>So I switched to rbenv. The switch was super easy, all I had to do was this:</p>

<p><em>Note: You can install it with Brew, but I wanted more control, so I installed it this way</em></p>

<p>``` bash
git clone <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git">https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git</a> ~/.rbenv</p>

<h1>I use ZSH so I&rsquo;m adding this to my .zshrc, if you use bash it should be your .bash_profile</h1>

<p>echo &lsquo;export PATH=&ldquo;$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH&rdquo;&rsquo; >> ~/.zshrc
```</p>

<p>I then installed <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build">ruby-build</a> which is used to compile and install the different versions of ruby. It&rsquo;s just as easy to install</p>

<p><code>bash
git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
</code></p>

<p>Now, you should be able to relaunch your terminal, and run <code>rbenv install --list</code> to see all the ruby versions that are availible for install. After that, it&rsquo;s just as simple as running `rbenv install 2.0.0-p427' to install Ruby 2.0.0</p>

<p>After you install a ruby version you can do a couple of different things.</p>

<p>``` bash
rbenv global 2.0.0-p247 # Set the Global Ruby version
rbenv local 1.9.3-p385</p>

<h1>Sets the local Ruby Version, also creates a .ruby-version file</h1>

<h1>and will automatically switch to that version when in that directory</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>The quick switching between ruby versions is the main reason I like using rbenv so much.</p>
