    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been building a rails engine over the past couple of weeks. As I near completion, I wanted to make sure that my engine was compatible with multiple versions of Rails.</p>

<p>The way that I found the easiest was outlined by Richard Schneeman (AKA <a href="https://github.com/schneems">schneems</a>) in his blog post <a href="http://www.schneems.com/post/50991826838/testing-against-multiple-rails-versions/">Testing Against Multiple Rails Versions</a></p>

<p>His example was given for a gem, using Travis CI. Lucky for me, I was also using Travis to test my engine, and modifying his approach wasn&rsquo;t too crazy.</p>

<p>So, in order to test your Rails Engine against multiple versions of rails you will want to do the following.</p>

<p>First, in your <code>.travis.yml</code> file you&rsquo;ll want to put the following ENV variables
```yml</p>

<h1>.travs.yml</h1>

<p>env:
  &ndash; &ldquo;RAILS_VERSION=3.2.0&rdquo;
  &ndash; &ldquo;RAILS_VERSION=4.0.0&rdquo;
  &ndash; &ldquo;RAILS_VERSION=4.1.0&rdquo;
```</p>

<p>You can see here I want to test against <code>Rails 3.2.0</code>, <code>Rails 4.0.0</code>, and <code>Rails 4.1.0</code>. You can put as many/any versions you want in that section.</p>

<p>Next, in your Gemfile put the following code</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Not your engine.gemspec file, in the Gemfile in the root directory of your rails Engine</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>Gemfile</h1>

<p>rails_version = ENV[&ldquo;RAILS_VERSION&rdquo;] || &ldquo;default&rdquo;</p>

<p>rails = case rails_version</p>

<p>when &ldquo;master&rdquo;
  {github: &ldquo;rails/rails&rdquo;}
when &ldquo;default&rdquo;
  &ldquo;>= 3.2.0&rdquo;
else
  &ldquo;~> #{rails_version}&rdquo;
end</p>

<p>gem &ldquo;rails&rdquo;, rails
```</p>

<p>Lastly, make sure in your <code>.gitignore</code> file you add your <code>Gemfile.lock</code>. This will make sure that Travis rebuilds the gems for your engine every time it tests against a new environment variable.</p>

<p>After that you&rsquo;re all done, you&rsquo;ll see that the number of test runs on Travis go up pretty substantially. As you can see in the image below Travis is testing against 3 different versions of Ruby, and 3 different versions of Rails. My tests may take longer now, but it&rsquo;s nice to know</p>
