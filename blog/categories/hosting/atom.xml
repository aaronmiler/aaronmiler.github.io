    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I started building my site on Octopress. Coming from Jekyll everything was rather familiar. While developing my site, I listened to a great podcast, called &ldquo;Jekyll and CMS-less websites with Young Hahn and Dave Cole&rdquo; on The Web Ahead. I won&rsquo;t attempt to summarize it as there is so much covered, and it really got me excited about using Jekyll. If you haven&rsquo;t listened to it, you can listen to it <a href="http://5by5.tv/webahead/54">here</a>.</p>

<p> As I got closer to finishing my site, I started to wonder about how I was going to host it. With my initial Jekyll set up I had just uploaded the static files to a Digital Ocean VPS and called it a day. But the Jekyll podcast got me thinking about hosting my site on GitHub pages for free, so I gave it a shot.</p>

<p>Very quickly I realized how easy it was to throw my site up on github pages. The directions for all of the pieces are a little scattered, so I figured I&rsquo;d put them all here for other Internet goers to enjoy.</p>

<h3>Setting up your GitHub Repo.</h3>

<p><a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> allows you to host static content on GitHub for free. There are two different type of GitHub Pages. There are Project Pages, and User/Orginization pages. The User/Orinization pages must follow this formation <em>username/username.github.io</em> and you can only create your own User/Org pages, you can&rsquo;t take somebody else&rsquo;s name. Project Pages behave a little differently. All you have to do for any given project is add a branch called gh-pages and that is the branch that GitHub will use to build the site. The User/Org page can be accessed from <a href="http://username.github.io">http://username.github.io</a> while the project pages are accessed from <a href="http://username.github.io/project.">http://username.github.io/project.</a></p>

<h3>Setting up your Octopress</h3>

<p>Out of the box Octopress is already all wired up to deploy to GitHub, all you have to do is give it the destination. All you have to do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run <em>rake setup_github_pages</em></li>
<li>Paste in your repo URL</li>
</ul>


<p>Octopress will then detect if its a User/Org repo, or a project page repo, and create the branches accordingly. If it&rsquo;s a user/org repo it will create your master branch, if it is a project page it will create the gh-pages branch for you.</p>

<h3>Deploying to GitHub</h3>

<p>As if this wasn&rsquo;t easy enough already, this part was just a breeze. All it takes, is running two simple commands</p>

<p><code>
rake generate
rake deploy
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. Octopress will push your blog to gitHub, and GitHub will build your pages. Since you&rsquo;re pushing static files to GitHub, you don&rsquo;t have to wait for it to compile the page like you would if it were pushing Jekyll source to gitHub.</p>

<h3>Adding your custom domain name</h3>

<p>GitHub makes this almost too easy. First go into your DNS settings and point your domain name to <code>204.232.175.78</code>. Then in the root of your site, add a file called CNAME. My cname file looks like this
<code>
aaronmiler.com
</code></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that easy. GitHub will set up some automatic redirects such as redirecting www.aaronmiler.com to aaronmiler.com, and it will also redirect traffic from aaronmiler.github.io to aaronmiler.com.</p>

<p>I was blown away by how easy this was. I&rsquo;ve often at work created very small rails apps for simple sites, or resorted to using Wordpress. After using Octopress, and Jekyll to push my content to GitHub. I think I have now found my new work flow for smaller sites.</p>
