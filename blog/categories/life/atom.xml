    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the beginning of March, my girlfriend and I rescued an 11 month of Siberian Husky. We decided to name him Helo (after Battlestar of course) and he is quite the handful.<!-- more --></p>

<p><span style="float:right;margin: 15px 0px 15px 20px;width:375px;">

<span style="display:block;text-align:center;"> My Husky, Helo </span>
</span></p>

<p>You see, Helo is just a constant ball of energy. We knew this going in, and so my plan was to start running with Helo every morning.</p>

<p>So after we got the dog, I started a new morning routine. Wake up at 6, grab the dog, and go out for a run. At first the running was a chore. I sometimes skipped it because I didn&rsquo;t feel like it, or maybe I was just lazy. But now I can&rsquo;t seem to bring myself to skip a day.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve realized, is that running is meditative for me. While I&rsquo;m running, I&rsquo;m not really thinking about anything. Work doesn&rsquo;t exist, that bug I&rsquo;ve been wrestling with doesn&rsquo;t exist, the roadblock for that new feature is irrelevant, nothing is on my mind. I&rsquo;m just running.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that this is a great way for me to start the day. My run energizes me, and gives me a chance to clear my head.</p>
