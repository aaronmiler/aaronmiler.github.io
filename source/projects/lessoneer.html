    When I first started at EdCaliber, the company had built a quick prototype
     for a new product. After looking over the new code, and asking if it met the
     needs of management, and our users. The team decided we would scope out a
     project written from the ground up. With a list of User Stories from our team,
      we set out to design a system that would meet our users expectations.
  </p>
  <p>
    A key component we had to build out of the gate was a Content Management System
     so that we could import Curriculum for teachers. This involved many in depth
     discussions around database design, desired file format, and the process of
     making updates without disrupting customers. We decided to implement a Git backed,
     markdown file format. This allowed our content team to have a consistent style,
     and made looking at diffs much easier for them.
   </p>
   <p>
     As the system grew to be more complex, we came to the conclusion that we needed
     to implement a front-end framework for more sophisticated interactions. At the
     time all the companies previous code had been written around Angular, but after
     the team did some exploration, and discovery, we decided React would be best for us.

   <h4>Components</h4>

   <h5>Content Importing</h5>
   <p>
     We needed a way to get curriculum into our system, that was easy for our content team
     and reliable from an import perspective. We landed on importing a zipfile
     containing markdown from GitHub. Our content team was given a breif standard of
     how the files should look, and the system processes the content tree into the system
     for our users. Along wtih the markdown content came resources to attach, tree structure,
     and other models within the system to link to the content.
   </p>

   <h5>Common Cartridge</h5>
   <p>
     Common Cartridge is standard format for curriculum. Some Learning Management Systems
     can export their content as Common Cartridge, and in order to get their content into
     our system easily, we needed to be able to import it. While Instructure had an
     open source gem that interfaced with Common Cartridge for Ruby, it had been archived,
     and was no longer in active development. This required us to fork the gem, and
     do some troubleshooting, and minor changes to implement the feature. The gem is unfortunatly
     archived, so the changes were unable to be pushed upstream for others.

   <h5>Academic Benchmark Common Core Standards</h5>
   <p>
     Academic Benchmarks is the leader in Learning Standards data. They have a very robust
     API, that most LMS systems pull from for standards data. Our first implementation of standards
     was a in-house built import, using our own data. As part of the differentiator for
     our SaaS was supplemental data we provided with Standards. However, over time, keeping up
     with changes, and adding new data sets became unruly.
     <br/><br/>
     After signing up for the Academic Benchmarks API, we starting leveraging their
     dataset for the backbone of the Standards data. Once again, Instructure had a
     Rubygem for interfacing with them, which essentially acted as a parser. So our
     system was still required to built the data tree in the backend, and assign
     things properly. There was a small change that was made to their gem, however
     the <a href="https://github.com/instructure/academic_benchmarks/pull/1" target="_blank">Pull Request</a>
     I opened has sat untouched for ~3 years.
