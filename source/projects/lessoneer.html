    <p>Case Study</p>

  <p>
    When I first started at EdCaliber, the company had built a quick prototype
     for a new product. After looking over the new code, and asking if it met the
     needs of management, and our users. The team decided we would scope out a
     project written from the ground up. With a list of User Stories from our team,
      we set out to design a system that would meet our users expectations.

    A key component we had to build out of the gate was a Content Management System
     so that we could import Curriculum for teachers. This involved many in depth
     discussions around database design, desired file format, and the process of
     making updates without disrupting customers. We decided to implement a Git backed,
     markdown file format. This allowed our content team to have a consistent style,
     and made looking at diffs much easier for them.
   </p>

     As the system grew to be more complex, we came to the conclusion that we needed
     to implement a front-end framework for more sophisticated interactions. At the
     time all the companies previous code had been written around Angular, but after
     the team did some exploration, and discovery, we decided React would be best for us.
