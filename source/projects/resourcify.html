  <h4>User Story</h4>
  <p>
    There are a number of freely avilable curriculum that teachers use. However, these
    curriculum are hosted in a few different places across the web. There are some great
    lists of supplemental resources, but they aren't available on any of the sites. Using
    a chrome extension, we should be able to provide the user with supplemental resources
    for whatever content they're viewing.
  </p>

  <h4>Components</h4>
  <h5>API Server</h5>
  <p>
    The chrome extension communicates with the rails server via asyncronis calls. Because
    we need to check what page the user is on, which can happen frequiently. These requests
    need to be fast. With that in mind, the API is built to pass the least amount of data
    possible, over multiple requests when the criteria is met.
  </p>

  <h5>Authentication</h5>
  <p>
    Resroucify's authentication was custom built out of the box. We knew that we'd want to
    allow users to safely log in using the extension, as well as on the site itself. So
    I decided the safest way was to email the user a one time use pin for logging in.
    Doing this allowed us to know the user could be logged in securely, even though we
    don't have full control over where they log in from.
  </p>

  <h5>Content Awareness</h5>
  <p>
    On navigation, the chrome extension asks the API server if it has any information about
    the current page it's on. If the server knows about the page, the extension proceeds
    to the next URL to get the full information. This allows the user to have all the
    initial data preloaded for them, before the extension is open.
  </p>

  <h5>Extension</h5>
  <p>
    The extension is a button in the extension area of their Chrome browser. The extension
    let's the user know when it's found resources, by changing color, and adding a badge
    with the count of resources.
    <br/>
    Building out the extension proved to be a tricky front-end problem to solve. Since we are
    injecting code into an unknown site. We needed to make sure that both the styles, and the
    Javascript code we wrote were scopped correctly. This meant styles had to be very explicit,
    and almost nothing could be left to the "default" as that coudl vary from site to site.
  </p>

  <h5>Social Network Features</h5>
  <p>
    We decided early on we'd want users to be able to vote (in a positive way) and comment on
    the resources that we made available. So we built in some social networking features.
    Once you create an account on the site, it allows you <code>Like</code> cards, comment on them,
    and even add your own. We also built a profile page, that can act as a shortcut for users to view
    the cards they've interacted with over time.
