  <h4>User Story</h4>
  <p>
    Maptribution was built out of a desire to not only save a bit of money, but
    also build a system that fit our usecase a bit more. I had experience using
    another applicaiton that was similar for a Shopify store, but it felt like it
    was lacking in some places. So I built an application that I felt addressed
    their shortcomings.

  <h4>Technology Used</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>MapBox and LeafletJS</li>
    <li>Shopify API</li>
    <li>Webpack with CoffeeScript</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Components</h4>
  <h5>Billing</h5>
  <p>
    I decided to build this app without an internal billing. Since the intention
    was for this app to be used with a Shopify store. I decieded to leverage them
    for billing. While they take the "standard" 30% cut, implementing this was
    much more straightforward than implementing stripe billing, and all the failure cases.
  </p>

  <h5>Map Box & LeafletJS</h5>
  <p>
    Since the applicaton was centered on a map, I did some diggin to see what my best
    option was for implemting it. After some reasearch, I landed on LeafletJS, Leaflet
    allows a little bit more flexibility, allowing me to not be completely locked
    in to a vendor. For the data side of things, I built the platform using MapBox.
    Using Mapbox for location autocomplete, as well as displaying the maps, it's simple
    for users to create maps of their delivery locations, and embed the map in their site.
