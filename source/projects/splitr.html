  <h4>User Story</h4>
  <p>
    Often in the education space, freely available curriculum can be found in PDF format.
    However, these PDFs can be hundreds of pages long, with the teacher needing to
    print, or digitally hand out a single page. While there are utilities for breaking up
    a PDF, it would be nice to have one that was education focused, and could suggest pages
    for things like "Chapter 7 Homework"
  </p>

  <h4>Technology Used</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>PDF.js</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>PDFtk</li>
    <li>Sidekiq</li>
    <li>Webpack with CoffeeScript</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Components</h4>
  <h5>Page Selector</h5>
  <p>
    The page selector on Splitr posed an interesting problem. Because of the desire to
    quickly display the PDF to the user, we used PDF.js to render it's contents to a canvas.
    However, if we used React, anytime the application thought it needed to rerender the
    component, PDF.js would have to rerun. This meant that the Page Selector, and rendering
    had to be written to vanilla Javascript. Using Object Oriented patterns, I created a
    Service Object, that acts as our stand in "Component" for the page selector.
  </p>

  <h5>Site Crawler</h5>
  <p>
    In addition to being able to directly upload a PDF, and split it. We wanted to give
    users the option to select PDFs from a webpage. In order to make this work, I created
    a web crawler, that crawls the given (public) URL from the user, and returns to them
    a list of the PDFs that we believe we're able to split. In addition to doing a simple
    search of the HTML for a .pdf extension. The cralwer also does it's best to do a <code>HEAD</code>
    request to other URLs, to try and determine if there are PDFs at the end of the URL.
  </p>

  <h5>Page Suggestions</h5>
  <p>
    Using data that we'd collected developing <a href='/projects/lessoneer'>Lessoneer</a> we
    knew where some documents began within larger PDFs. Utilizing AWS Mechanical Turk, I built an
    interface for people to help us identify the page ranges for sub-documents.

  </p>

  <h5>Chrome extension</h5>
  <p>
    With the cralwer built above, we wanted to give teachers a quick way to crawl a webpage
    for PDFs. So I built a simple chrome extension, that opens up their currently active URL
    and tab, in Splitr. Allowing them to streamline their process, and get their file with
    fewer steps.
