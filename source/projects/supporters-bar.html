  <h4>User Story</h4>
  <p>
    If you spend enough time in an online community for a soccer team. Someone eventually
    will ask a question along the lines of
    <code>"Are there any good bars for watching the game in #{LOCATION}?"</code>
    Supporter's Bar intends to answer that question, a little bit more througouhly.
    Utilizing some data scraped from an existing list, I built a backend, and front end
    for soccer fans.
    <br/><br/>
    Supporter's Bar was built to answer this question, primarily for myself when I travel,
    but with enough data, it could become the go to source for soccer fans.

  <h4>Technology Used</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>MapBox and LeafletJS</li>
    <li>Google Places API</li>
    <li>Webpack with CoffeeScript</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Components</h4>
  <h5>Interacive Map</h5>
  <p>
    Much like <a href="/projects/maptribution">Maptribution</a>, Supporter's Bar
    utilized Leaflet, MapBox, and React to implement the map. The cheif difference
    between the two, is where the backend is focused. Using PostGIS, and Ruby's Geocoder
    gem, we search the database for locations that meet our criteria near our starting
    Lat/Long.
  </p>

  <h5>Google Places API</h5>
  <p>
    While I started out with a dataset of bars already. I thought that <code>"You can watch
    the game at #{BAR}"</code> was a pretty boring answer. Using the Google Places API,
    I'm able to pull some extra data. Like contact information, price range, and overall
    rating on Google.
