Last year I bought a full year calendar to hang on my wall. It was a pretty great way
for me to get at a glance information for what I had going on. Unfortunately I couldn't
find the one I bought last year, so this year I'm going without one.

<!-- more -->

However, what this inspired me to do, is build something to facilitate what the
calendar provided, at a glance information.

I can't tell you how often I ask Siri the same questions over and over.

> What's the weather?

> What's the forecast?

> When is my next meeting?

I have decided to build myself an application that for now, I'm calling Docket.

Docket will provide me with at a glance information for my schedule, weather, and
who knows what else I may add to it.

My plan is to blog about the interesting problems that I have to solve while
building this application, in hopes that someone else can learn form my experiences,
or even that I may help myself down the road.

So, without further ado. `rails new Docket`
