A couple of months ago I sarcastically said I was going to make an app for my girlfriend. Much to my surprise shortly after, she asked me if I could make that app for her, for her birthday. So I agreed to it. I've been wanting to get into the iOS space for a while, and this gave me some good motivation.

In the past I've tried to get into the mobile app space. I've tried Appcelerator, Phonegap, and Cordova. None of which were really quite what I was looking for, and because each of the tools aimed for cross platform abilities. You lost some of the device features. Now while it's possible that these tools have evolved, I really wasn't a big fan of how they worked. 

While at Railsconf I attended [a talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v3_t5SK8DM) about something called [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com). RubyMotion lets you right iOS apps in Ruby. The biggest appeal to me is that Rubymotion doesn't actually run the application in Ruby. It compiles to executable code that interacts with the iOS device. Meaning there are no features lost when using Rubymotion.

After completing the Rails powered API for the iPhone application I intend to make. I quickly purchased a Rubymotion license key, and realized I have no idea what I'm doing. Luckly I was able to find [a nice book about Rubymotion](http://pragprog.com/book/carubym/rubymotion) from the pragmatic press. Hopefully this will get me up and running with Rubymotion.

I almost forgot to mention my favorite feature of Rubymotion. When you fire up your application to debug on your phone or a virtual device. You also get the Rubymotion REPL. Which is just like running IRB on a Rails application. This allows you to update your app and see the changes real time in your terminal. It's pretty awesome firing up a completely blank application, and telling it to display an alert message from the terminal. 

TL;DR Take a good look at Rubymotion. It's cool
