    <h4>Maptribution</h4>
    <p>
      I built Maptribution to replace a Shopify app that wasn't quite doing
      what I wanted on a Shopify store I built. I used this project to learn
      how to integrate Shopify billing into a project.

    <h4>Supporter's Bar</h4>
    <p>
      Often in the Timbers' and MLS communities, someone (myself included) is
      looking for a place to watch the game away from home, with other fans. There
      are a few scattered data sets out there, Supporter's Bar is intended to be
      a one stop shop for finding a great place to watch the game.

      Supporter's Bar was my first interaction using MapBox, Leaflet.js, and PostgreSQLs PostGIS.
      The combination of these tools allowed me to rapidly develop a system,
      that given the proper data could become the "Yelp" of finding a sports bar.
